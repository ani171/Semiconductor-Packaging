Why is semiconductor packaging needed?
- When dies/chips come out of the wafer, they are made in a protected environment, but ICs are exposed to the real world. So packaging:
  1. Enables the die to connect to other dies
  2. Protection of semiconductor devices (Corrosion, moisture, and physical damage)
